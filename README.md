# Stock Price Predictor

## Description
This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on stock price data and can provide predictions for future prices.

## How to Run the Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nxdo1x/stock-price-predictor.git
   cd stock-price-predictor
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app1.py

4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the app.
   
5. Dependencies
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
streamlit
yfinance

You can install all dependencies at once using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Example of Using the Code
In the stockpricer.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, you can explore the code that preprocesses the data, trains the LSTM model, and visualizes the predictions. The notebook includes comments explaining each step of the process.

import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Fetch historical stock data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2010-01-01', end='2019-12-31')

# Preprocess the data
data = data[['Close']]
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Further processing and model training steps...
